## Clock project ⏰⌚

In this project, our goal is to create a simple clock, with hours, minutes, seconds and AM/PM indication. To execute it, make sure you have Python 3.10 installed, open the file main.py and execute it. The result is the current time in a interface. 

## What I learnt 🧑🏻‍💻:

-  My first concepts of a GUI in Python, reviewd functions, how to import modules and to study with projects. 
-  <b>tkinter and tkinter.ttk </b> modules - It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. General purpose are: widgets, displays, buttons etc. 
-  <b>tkinter Label:</b> It is a widget where you can display text or images. In our code, we used it to show the time (the time format is a string). 
-  label.after(): used for update an interface after some time.
