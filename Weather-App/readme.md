## Weather Application 📊🌍☁️⛅🌨️🌤️🌪️🌫️

In this project, I used a common API to get the current weather informations around the world (more info. bellow). The GUI although is very simple, is quite intuitive. So, to see the current 
weather, just type a city name or a country and hit enter. You should see informations about the temperature in ℃, pressure, humidity, wind speed and the sunrise and sunset time.
