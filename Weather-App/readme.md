## Weather Application 🌍☁️⛅🌨️🌤️🌪️🌫️

In this project, I used a common API to get the current weather informations around the world (more info. bellow). The GUI although is very simple, is quite intuitive. So, to see the current weather, just type a city name or a country and hit enter. You should see informations about the temperature in ℃, pressure, humidity, wind speed and the sunrise and sunset time.


## What I learnt 🧑🏻‍💻📝

-  Application Programming Interface (API): a set of functions and procedures allowing the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service;
-  How easy and fast is to write code using an API;
-  Still learning about interfaces using the Tkinter module;
-  How to acces JSON data format and other things.
